# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Ivan Krasin"      # Your name
  title:        "Guess My Number"      # Project title
  description:  "A tiny game to guess an 8-bit number based on 7-segment display hints"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "8 input bits define a number guess. The 7-segment display shows how far the guess with 0 being a win and larger numbers meaning that the guess is off. The goal is to find a number that gives 0."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set all inputs to zero, it must show something like 6 or 7 on a 7-segment display."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  wokwi_id:     0       # the wokwi ID
  picture:      ""      # relative path to a picture in your repository
  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - bit 0 of a guess
    - bit 1 of a guess
    - bit 2 of a guess
    - bit 3 of a guess
    - bit 4 of a guess
    - bit 5 of a guess
    - bit 6 of a guess
    - bit 7 of a guess
  outputs:
    - 7-segment display + a dot.
